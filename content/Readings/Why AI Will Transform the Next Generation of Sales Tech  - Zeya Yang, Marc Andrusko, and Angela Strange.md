> **We believe AI will so fundamentally reimagine the core system of record and the sales** [**workflows**](https://a16z.com/owning-the-workflow-in-b2b-ai-apps/) **that no incumbent is safe**.

**A new system of record**
Old: structured, text in rows and columns
New: LLM, image, voice, video. Diversified data entries that are best analyzed by AI models.

**Redefining workflows**

**Early days of the future**
- connect results from adjacent spaces
- generate lead lists (潜在客户名单)
- digital workers
- Sales enablement + insights
- Customer Relationship Management (CRM) + automations

**Market impact**
> Sales, marketing, and customer success will blend together
> In fact, it’s possible that as all important customer context is reflected in the same source of truth, and as activities are guided by the AI, job functions could start to blend together.

Fluid Go-to-market strategies

Per seat pricing → outcome-based pricing
- new metrics for pricing

> **Conclusion**
> 
> AI’s potential will not be limited to streamlining the sales activities we have today; instead AI will compel us to reimagine sales processes and workflows completely. The relationship between sellers and buyers will evolve, as will GTM strategies. Hence, the sales software stack in the future will look fundamentally different.
