Zappos pay money to new hires for leaving the company. To the CEO, this just gets rid of people only here for a paycheck. They are not ideal for building a culture.

> "We really wanted to build the company around culture, company culture being the number one priority. And it’s much easier to build a culture when it’s actually in person versus remotely by email."

>"There’s a lot of talk about work life separation or balance and so on, our whole thing is about work life integration. Its just life. And so the ideal would be if you can be the same person at home as you are in the office, and vice versa. And when people actually feel comfortable being themselves, so much creativity comes out of that.”
- This type of "letting employees be more free to be themselves=better creativity" is also reflected in [[(video) Creative mornings with Ben Chestnut(MailChimp)]]
