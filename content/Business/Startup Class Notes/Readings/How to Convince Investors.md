Master List: [[Stanford Startup Course Master List]]

**You shouldn't try to convince investors with the pitch. It's better to let the startup do the work.**

> Most(investors) are interested in you if you seem like you have a chance, however small, of being one of the 15 big successes, and otherwise not.

> How do you see mike you'll be one of the big successes? You need three things: formidable founders, a promising market, and (usually) some evidence of success so far.

#### Formidable
> Formidable is roughly justified confidence.
- not exactly = confidence
> The most important ingredient is formidable founders. **Most investors decide in the first few minutes whether you seem like a winner or a loser,** and once their opinion is set it's hard to change.

Successful founders don't usually seem formidable first
	the family and education encourages humble
	*don't try to imitate the swagger though* - investor can tell

#### Truth
> The way to seem most formidable as an inexperienced founder is to stick to the truth.

But sometimes even saying the truth does not seem formidable -- **you need to convince yourself first.**
	And Convince yourself with solid reasons!

> That's the secret. Convince yourself that your startup is worth investing in, and then when you explain this to investors they'll believe you.

**Be a domain expert. Know everything about your market.**

**And truly think about whether you company needs investment at the current stage**
> The time to raise money is not when you need it, or when you reach some artificial deadline like a Demo Day. It's when you can convince investors, and not before.

#### Market
> To prove you're worth investing in, you don't have to prove you're going to succeed, just that you're a sufficiently good bet.
- Investors can't tell if your company "is going to succeed or not". You just need to be a good bet.

You should show that the market eventually will be very big, whether by growing from a small market or moving to a bigger one.

> Â three month old company at Demo Day only needs to be a promising experiment that's worth funding to see how it turns out. Whereas a two year old company raising a series A round needs to be able to show the experiment worked.
- It's harder to get investment as the time goes on.

Identify the external wave you're riding and how you'll benefit.
	Why now? What hasn't someone else already done it?
	A good reason is that the idea only becomes good recently.

#### Rejection
The most a startup can do is look good, not GREAT. So even good startups can be turned down by VCs. What do you do if rejected?

What if an investor says "who else is investing?"
	Good investors usually don't care about this, but mediocre investors mostly do.

Risky move: tell that other investors are about to invest
Best move: directly answer the question
- why investors have turned you down - ask them respectfully
- why they're mistaken

The good ideas look initially like [[How to Get Startup Ideas - Paul Graham|bad ideas]]. Good investors know it and mediocre ones don't. They can make very different decisions on investing.
- Example: Dropbox. The investors in Boston took the first look but none invested, but Sequoia did. 

#### Different
> So here's the recipe for impressing investors when you're not already good at seeming formidable:
> 1. Make something worth investing in.  
>       
>     
> 2. Understand why it's worth investing in.  
>       
>     
> 3. Explain that clearly to investors.
> 
> If you're saying something you know is true, you'll seem confident when you're saying it. Conversely, never let pitching draw you into bullshitting. As long as you stay on the territory of truth, you're strong. Make the truth good, then just tell it.
