Master List: [[Startup Readings Master List]]

What you think the enterprise space will look like in the next five years?
	In the past, technology trickle down from the top government facilities to large corporations to small businesses to individuals. Now, the newest and interesting technology start with the individual users and then small businesses... The other way around.
		This is because in the past, there are barriers of entry. But now, everyone has a phone in their hand. And they can make decisions faster than large corporations.

Consumer business vs. Enterprise business
	Consumer business: larger user base, more predictable
	Enterprise business: not as subject to consumer trend, fad, behavior

> But I would say the market is schizophrenic. So right now we are in an era where the market wants enterprise companies. I am just saying like wait a year, that will flip again; wait another year after that, that will flip again.

**It's the same for hype. People get hyped up by Internet consumer products until the dot com crash, but then they get excited again.**

**Things will always get better and better, people just don't get excited about it at the same time.**

**Right now, the "enterprise" gets more and more light weight, which gives small businesses an advantage.**

> We really look for the entrepreneurs who say the following, they say: “I have this really good idea and I know it’s a good idea for the following eight reasons, and I have thought about it and I have worked in the field, and I know what I am doing, and I have talked to the customers and I have figured it out, and I am going to do it. I am just going to flat-out do it. And I am going to do it whether you fund me or whether you don’t fund me or I don’t get funded. I am still going to do it.” That’s the entrepreneur we are looking for.
