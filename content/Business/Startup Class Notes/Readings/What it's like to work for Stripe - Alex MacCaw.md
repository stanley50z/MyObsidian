> A company's culture can be just as important to success as revenues or growth.

**Email transparency**
Every email at Stripe is CC-ed to either the entire company or to any particular team. This includes internal person-to-person correspondence.
- low friction way to keep everyone in the loop
- preserve openness and trust

**All hands**
One meeting every week for each team to explain last week's progress and future plan.
Address **FUD**: Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt
- prevents problem from staying hidden in one small part of the company

**Group activities**
- Get together for lunch
- Social list for after work activities
- Yearly hackathons

**Everybody does support**
same as Wufoo in [[Lec 7 - How to Build Products Users Love (Kevin Hale)]].
It's the one of the best ways to learn abou:
- the company
- how everything works internally
- our customer's needs.

**IM & IRC**
Chat is good way to communicate asynchronously, so it's more responsive than emails and less bothering than face2face.

An IRC bo messages me every six hours to ask me to optionally reply with brief description of whatever I'm working on..

**Exploration**
- New hires work for different teams in the first few days to get familiarized with the codebase and team members. This enables them to work with the teams and maybe switch teams later.
- Encourage employees to be generalists, and not to be afraid of exploring unfamiliar domains.
