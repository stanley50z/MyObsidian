Master List: [[Stanford Startup Course Master List]]

### 1. Single Founder
Why single founder usually doesn't work:
- No confidence. It's alarming that the founder couldn't even get one of their friends on board.
- No one to brainstorm with and rule out the bad ideas.
- No one there to cheer you up at low points

### 2. Bad Location
It's unknown [what exactly make SV SV](https://paulgraham.com/siliconvalley.html), but SV does produce much more startups than elsewhere.
- Experts are there
- Supporting industry are there
- People you want to hire also want to live there

### 3. Marginal Niche
Startups often suffer from choosing a marginal niche to avoid competitions. However, good ideas often face competition, so you might as well face that.
- it's human nature to choose 'safer' decision, so a good question to ask is "what would others do?"

### 4. Derivative Idea
It's usually not good to work an idea from an existing one. Like, copying 80% of an existing product and improving the 20% is still a bad startup idea. [[Lec 5 - Competition is for losers (Peter Thiel)| Competition is for losers]].

Instead, work from a problem you identified. It's a good sign that the problem is personal. 

### 5. Obstinacy
You shouldn't strictly stick to your vision, this doesn't work for startups.

Be ready to pivot, and the hardest part is often discarding your old idea.
- A good test can be: is what you built previously helpful for the new direction?
- and, do your users like it?

### 6. Hiring Bad Programmers
This usually happens when the founder is not a technical one. You are really doomed if you cannot tell if someone is a good programmer.

### 7. Choosing the Wrong Platform
One way to avoid this one is to avoid the previous one: hire good programmers and let them decide.

Also, you can look into what top-tier university research teams are using.

### 8. Slowness in Launching
One reason to launch quickly is that it forces you to actually *finish* some quantum of work.
- don't wait until it's 100% done - you'll wait forever
Another reason is you can only fully understand your problem after you launch it and get feedbacks.

### 9. Launching Too Early
Although the danger of launching too early is much smaller than launching too slowly, it still exists. 

The danger of launching to early is that you ruin your reputation. Your early adopter try it out, hate it, and never come back.

One tip is to work on the smallest but useful subset of feature you want to use. This is better because:
- it still delivers *something* useful that early adopters can tolerate
- and you'll know better what to do next
- and what you build is at least still useful for the full product, so you're not wasting your time. 

### 10. Having No Specific User in Mind
You can't build things users like without understanding them.
Better: solve a problem of your own. You understand that problem the best
Okay: it's ok to build something for others, but be cautious.
	You should constantly test if things work or not, not staying on your intuitions
	You should really try to understand who your users are, and be specific
Worse: not having specific users in mind.

### 11. Raising Too Little Money
The size of raising depends how much it requires to get to the next step. If you have an idea, next step is a working prototype, then launching, then scaling.

To have maximum flexibility, set both how much to spend and how far the next step is **low**. Also, raise 50-100% more than what you expect.

### 12. Raising Too Much Money
The money itself isn't the problem, but what the money brings
- Investors are more eager to see returns, no patience
- more fixated in one direction and less flexibility
- change in atmosphere
- bigger investment cost more time and energy raising it
	Therefore, take the the first reasonable deal and get back to work [[How to Raise Money - Paul Graham|ASAP]]
### 13. Spending Too Much
Judge by comparing to other start-ups.
Most common to spend too much is by hiring a lot of people, so:
- don't hire if you can avoid it, only hire people you need
	- and [[Lec 10 - Culture (Brian Chesky, Alfred Lin)|culture]] is important too 
- pay people with equity > salary

### 14. Poor Investor Management
It's better to ignore investors than cave in to them. You are the one who know what you're doing, not them.

Unfortunately, if the company is facing a challenge, investors can be in your way to fix it.

### 15. Sacrificing Users to Profit
Building a product that users want is 10x more important than figuring out the right business model.

Solve the problem first, worry about monetization later.

### 16. Not Wanting to Get Your Hands Dirty
[[Do things that Donâ€™t Scale - Paul Graham]]
Go acquire those users, manually

### 17. Fight Between Founders
It's more common than you think. Maybe do vesting so people leave orderly if that ever happens. If it does happen, it's a problem, but still recoverable.

The best way to avoid this is by not starting the company with them in the first place. Don't compromise on the founders team.

### 18.  A Half-Hearted Effort
Devote yourself into the start-up. Quit your day job, and if you don't have the determination, maybe you don't want to do the startup in your deeper mind anyways.
