Master List: [[Stanford Startup Course Master List]]

> Hiring is probably the most important thing a founder does.

Advices:
- Spend a lot of time on hiring. Don't cheap out, don't be lazy
- Know the roles you are hiring for. Don't hire someone just because you don't want to do it.
- Hire smart, effective people
- **Have people audition for roles instead of interviewing for them**
	Let them do a day of work(as a contractor). You'll know much better what it's like to work with them
- **Use personal networks more when hiring. Make star employees write out a list. Reach out to investors and their networks to find candidates.**
- Don't be limited to those looking for jobs. Great people are never looking for jobs. Don't be limited in your physical area as well.
- **Hire people you like. Have a set of cultural values.** See [[The Happiness Culture - Steven Rosenbaum|this]] and [[Donâ€™t Fuck Up the Culture - Brian Chesky|this]]
- **Don't compromise, especially in the early days.** Don't just hire someone because you really need to get a job done.
- **Be generous with compensation packages, but mostly with equity.**

- Watch out for red flags and trust your gut.
- Always be recruiting. Don't just do it before you need someone.
- **Fire fast.**
- Put a little bit of rigor around the hiring process.
Questions to ask:
- past project -- the actual job they did and how it applies to the startup
- how they spend their time during an average day
- how would they solve the startup's problem
