[How to get startup ideas](https://www.paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)
[[Startup Readings Master List]]
- Don't think of startup ideas, look for problems
	- The problem is real if a group of users urgently need a solution, not sth they might use
	- sth many people want some, or sth some people want a lot? Choose the latter 
- **Be at the leading edge of a field, and you'll know what's missing**
- Study in seemingly unrelated field can give you more insights for startup ideas
- Good idea may seen obvious, but it's never too late
	- startup rarely gets killed by competition
- Turn off the "unsexy" filter and the "schlep" filter
- Think of what would replace sth in the future, not what would replace it now

>  Finding startup ideas is a subtle business, and that's why most people who try fail so miserably. It doesn't work well simply to try to think of startup ideas. If you do that, you get bad ones that sound dangerously plausible. The best approach is more indirect: if you have the right sort of background, good startup ideas will seem obvious to you. But even then, not immediately. It takes time to come across situations where you notice something missing. And often these gaps won't seem to be ideas for companies, just things that would be interesting to build. Which is why it's good to have the time and the inclination to build things just because they're interesting.
