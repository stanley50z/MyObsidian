[[Startup Readings Master List]]

> You have to know that growth is what you're after. The good news is, if you get growth, everything else tends to fall into place. Which means you can use growth like a compass to make almost every decision you face.
#### Redwoods
Startups are designed to grow fast
- Startups have a special DNA that differentiates from newly founded companies

For a company to grow really big, it must:
(a) make something lots of people want,
(b) reach and serve all those people.

Startups should do both

#### Ideas
Technology are idea-enabler. [[How to Get Startup Ideas - Paul Graham|Ideas]] that used to be bad could turn good as technology develops.
- Example 1: Apple. PC is a bad idea at the time because no one wants it, but as technology makes PC more accessible, Apple is already established
- Example 2: Google. Improving the search engine becomes more and more important as the internet grow in size.

> That's one connection between startup ideas and technology. Rapid change in one area uncovers big, soluble problems in other areas.

#### (Growth) Rate
There are no standards for how fast a startup should grow.
So the real question is: what growth rate successful startups tend to have. And it usually look like these three phases:
> 1. There's an initial period of slow or no growth while the startup tries to figure out what it's doing.
> 2. As the startup figures out how to make something lots of people want and how to reach those people, there's a period of rapid growth.
> 3. Eventually a successful startup will grow into a big company. Growth will slow, partly due to internal limits and partly because the company is starting to bump up against the limits of the markets it serves.

Growth **rate** matters, not the sheer size of it.

#### Goal
Setup a goal of growth, and try to reach it every time. At YC, a good growth rate is 5-7% a week.

Having this goal forces the founder to act and focus on the only important thing, which is growth.
