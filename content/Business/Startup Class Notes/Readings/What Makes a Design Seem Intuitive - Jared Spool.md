#### Closing the Knowledge Gap
![[image.gif]]
Span all users based on how familiar they are with the product.
- This looks continuous, but users usually form clear clusters

Current Knowledge Point is what users already know
Target Knowledge Point is what's required to know to perform the action

**Intuitive design should bridge this knowledge gap**
There are two ways to do this:
- Raise the current level knowledge - teach users how to perform actions
- Lower the target threshold - make it easier to perform actions

**Good design usually do both**

#### Two Conditions of Intuitive
Condition 1: there's no knowledge gap. 
	Users see the interface, they know wha to do.
Condition 2: Users naturally reach target knowledge
	Users are completely unaware that the design is helping them.

It's better to do the 1st, building on past norms that users are already used to. But doing the 2nd is also fine.

#### Making Designs Seem Intuitive
So now the question becomes: 
	*How to figure out the current and target knowledge levels?*
- For current level
	Field studies. Watching potential users working with their normals set of tools.
- For target level
	Usability testing. Watching users trying to use the product can bring out insights.

#### Intuitive Doesn't Always Make Sense
Making an interface intuitive is a lot of work and cost. Sometimes it's unnecessary to make the interface intuitive.
- Example: Amazon makes it hard to find phone number for customer support, because it's costly to build a call center to handle the volume of users they have.
	This might not be the *right* thing to do, but it makes sense.

#### Understanding How Intuitive Works
Once you understand what it takes to make the product more intuitive, you can better decide if it is worth effort.
