> What do I mean by politics? I mean people advancing their careers or agendas by means other than merit and contribution.

### How it Happens
**Scenario**: an employee asks for a raise because of current market and other offers. So investigate the situation, or even give a raise.

This is bad because:
- Employees earn a raise by asking someone, rather than automatically be granted one because of their outstanding performance
- Other ambitious members will start asking for raises as well.
- Those who are apolitical get denied a raise.
- Employee start asking people for other stuff.

### How to minimize politics
It's different when dealing executive/seniors vs juniors.

1. **Hire people with the right kind of ambition** - the ambition should be the success of the company. Personal success is only by-product, not the main goal
2. **Build strict processes for potentially political issues and do not deviate**
	- **Performance and compensation** - build a well structured, regular performance and compensation reviews. Do it in groups, no individually
	- **Organizational design and territory** - if ambitious people want expand their scope of responsibility, **don't respond with reasons/intentions**. Generally, it's best to say nothing at all.
	- **Promotions** - have a formal, visible, defensible promotion process that governs every employee promotion.
3. **Be careful with "he said, she said"**
	- **Complaints about behavior** - address conflicts by having both parties in the same room
	- **Complaints about competency/performance** - 
		- If you already know about it - you've let the situation go too far, that the organization starts to distrust. This usually result in firing.
		- If it's news to you - **immediately stop the conversation and disagree**. Do not let an accusation grow. Then, **quickly re-assess the employee in question.**
