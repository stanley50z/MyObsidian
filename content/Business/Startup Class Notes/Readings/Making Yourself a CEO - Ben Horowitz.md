> Being CEO requires lots of unnatural motion.

It's natural to make people like you, but CEO's job is to provide feedback, which is unnatural because it upsets people in the short run.

### The Shit Sandwich
describes the way to give feedback:
- start with complimenting them - bread
- give them the difficult message - the shit
- wrap up by reminding them how much you value their strength
This makes the critique more on the behavior, not on the person.

**However**, this may not work after a few times for junior employees, and this immediately get recognized by senior employees.

### The Keys
Instead of always relying on the shit sandwich, develop a style that matches your own personality and values.
- *Be authentic* - don't say things to manipulate the recipient's feelings
- *Come from the right place* - make yourself feel helpful
- *Don't get personal*
- *Don't clown people in front of their peers* - it doesn't work
- *Feedback is customized toward the receiver*
- *Be direct, but not mean* - be direct tho

### Feedback is a dialogue, not a monologue
You may be wrong, so let employees talk. Encourage people to challenge your judgment.

Apply tremendous pressure to get the highest quality thinking, yet be open enough to find out when you're wrong.

### High frequency feedback
> As CEO, you should have an opinion on absolutely everything.
- give feedback to everything
This can have two benefits:
- feedback won't be personal in your company. Everyone will just get used to it, and focus on the issues, not evaluations.
- people will become comfortable discussing bad news. so problems are more exposed.

### Making the CEO
> If you are a founder CEO and you feel awkward or incompetent when doing some of these things and believe there is no way that you’ll be able to do it when your company is 100 or 1,000 people, welcome to the club. That’s exactly how I felt.  So did every CEO that I’ve ever met. This is the process. This is how you get made.
