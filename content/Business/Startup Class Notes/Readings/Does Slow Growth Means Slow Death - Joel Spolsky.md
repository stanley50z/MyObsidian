Master List: [[Startup Readings Master List]]

In the essay, Spolsky presents two companies:
- Company A: has a better product, more market share, solid and steady growth
- Company B: appears to have a faster, exponential growth but also struggles to deliver and fulfill demands.

> "What set Oracle apart from Ingres," Moore writes, "was that CEO Larry Ellison drove for 100 percent growth while Ingres 'accepted' 50 percent growth."
> …
> Moore explains that "for pragmatist customers, the first freedom in a rapidly shifting market is order and security. That can only come from rallying around a clear market leader(Company B). Once the apparent leader-to-be emerges, pragmatists will support that company, virtually regardless of how arrogant, unresponsive, or overpriced it is."

So Spolsky asks this question to himself: is his company Ingres?

And he proposes a few steps to drive growth.
1. Defeat the last reason to choose the competitors. Spolsky is already confident that they have a better product. Pick out the little features that competitors have. (Is this against the [[Lec 5 - Competition is for losers (Peter Thiel)|monopoly>competition]] rule?)
2. Build up a sales team. It’s wrong to think that customers will just come to you because you have a product. 
	- This is somewhat mentioned in [[Lec 6 - Growth (Alex Schultz)]] but I didn’t take notes on it.
