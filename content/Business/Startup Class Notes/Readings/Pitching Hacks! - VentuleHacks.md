Master List: [[Startup Readings Master List]]

> **SUMMARY**
> Don’t spam investors with your business plan. Instead, convince **middlemen** to introduce you to investors. An effective middleman is simply someone investors listen to — often another entrepreneur or investor.
> 
> Find middlemen by picking up the phone and calling everyone you know, who knows investors well, who will listen to you. Then use these tools to pitch middlemen and investors alike:
> 
> 1. An **elevator pitch**. The major components of an elevator pitch are traction, product, team, and social proof. And investors care about traction over everything else.
> 2. Your elevator pitch should include a **high-concept pitch**: a single sentence that distills your startup’s vision. A high- concept pitch is the perfect meme for fans and investors who are spreading the word about your company.
> 3. Also consider sending investors a “ten-slide” **deck** that tells a compelling story about your team, product, traction, and plans.
> 4. You don’t need a “**business plan**.”
> Finally, **don’t ask for an NDA** — investors won’t sign one. Your elevator pitch and deck probably won’t get in the hands of the competition, but you should assume they will. So don’t share information that must remain confidential.

### Traction (p15-18)
- a measure of your product's engagement with its market, a.k.a. product/market fit
> Do whatever is required to eat to product/market fit.
- traction + market size > product/team

### Introductions(p19-30)
- Middleman rank: entrepreneurs > other investors > market/product experts > lawyers
	know about their relation with investors, like how they met, worked in the past, etc
> An effective middleman is simply someone investors listen to.

**Bad introductions** 
- Investors who don't have a good reason to not invest (in you but offers you introduction to other investors). *Instead, ask for the names and get your own introductions to them.*
- Middlemen who the investors barely know or trust.

**How to get introductions**
- Call every middlemen you know.
- Explain why the investors would be interested by high-concept pitch and elevator pitch.
- If your company is interesting, you'll get introductions
- Get the middleman to focus on making a single great introduction
- Consider making middlemen advisors as an incentive
- If it doesn't work, ask the middleman to recommend investors or other middlemen.

**What should I send middlemen**
- elevator pitch, deck
- no NDA, no business plan or executive summary

**'Professional' pay-to-play middlemen are usually not worth the money, but sometimes they can be very helpful**

### High-Concept Pitches(p31-40)
**What makes a good high-concept pitch?**
- It should be brief, like one short sentence or phrase
- your audience should already understand the building blocks of the pitch
- should probably be different from your company's tagline.
**Why should I write a high-concept pitch?**
- It used by fans/customers/investors/media to describe your company.
- A high-concept pitch is the best way to describe your product within an elevator pitch
**Aren't high-concept pitches too simple?**
- They are simple by design so that people get interested. It's to start a conversation, not end one. 
- You simple don't have the chance to tell your story all at once, so start by summarizing it in one sentence.

### Elevator Pitches
An elevator pitch is something you can send to the middleman which they can send to the investors.
Example: 
> Subject: Introducing Ning to Blue Shirt Capital [A useful subject line!] 
> Hi [Middleman], Thanks for offering to introduce us to Blue Shirt Capital. [Reiterating the social proof of the introducer.] I've attached a short presentation about our company, Ning. [I attached a deck.] 
> Briefly, Ning lets you create your own social network for anything. For free. In 2 minutes. [What’s the high concept pitch? What does the product help the customer do? Who is the customer?] It's as easy as starting a blog. [What's the metaphor?] Try it at: http://ning.com [Link to the product, screencast, or screenshots.] 
> We built Ning to unlock the great ideas from people all over the world who want to use this amazing medium in their lives. [What's the big problem or opportunity?]
> We have over 115,000 user-created networks, and our page views are growing 10% per week. [Traction.] We previously raised $44M from Legg Mason and others, including myself. [More traction and social proof.] 
> Before Ning, I started Netscape (acquired by AOL for $4.2B) and Opsware (acquired by HP for $1.6B). [Team’s past successes.] 
> 
> Blue Shirt’s investments in companies like Extensive Enterprises tell me that they could be a great partner for Ning. [Why are you interested in this investor?] We're starting meetings with investors next week, and I would love to show Blue Shirt what we're building at Ning. [Call to action and subtle scarcity.] 
> Best, Marc Andreessen xyz@ning.com 415.555.1212 [Contact information — how thoughtful.] 

When in doubt, follow this template exactly. Keep the product description(and the overall pitch) brief. Try to keep the pitch under 100 words.
- You can also try to format it in bullet points.

### Decks
> *PowerPoint plans greatly increase your chance of getting a term sheet, or at least the dignity of a quick no.*

A deck is a PowerPoint presentation that provides more details about your business, like problem, solution, sales, and marketing, those aren't in your elevator pitch.

**Template**
1. **Cover** - logo, tagline, complete contact information
2. **Summary** - key, compelling facts
3. **Team** - highlight the past accomplishments of the team
4. **Problem** - Describe the customer, market, and problem you address, without getting into your product. Emphasize the pain level and inability of competitors to satisfy the need.
5. **Solution** - product, how it addresses the problem. include screenshots, links.
6. **Technology** - Describe the technology behind your solution. How the technology enables the differentiated aspects of your solution. Mention patent status.
7. **Marketing** - Customers, market, elaborate the problem. How to acquire users? How many already acquired?
8. **Sales** - Business model, sales, pipelines. Microeconomics. 
9. **Competition** - Why customers use your product instead of the competition's. Describe any competitive advantages that remain after the competition decides to copy you exactly.
10. **Milestones** - Current status and prospective milestones for the nest 1-3 quarters for your product, team, marketing, and sales.
11. **Conclusion** - inspirational, larger vision
12. **Financing** - Date, amounts, sources of money raised. How much you raising this round?

> You should almost always do a demo at the start of a presentation, right after you introduce yourself

**Format your deck**
- Keep the slides simple, visual, and minimal. Use 30+ font
- Put talking points, reasoning in notes that accompany each slide. Don't cram them into bullet points on the slides.
- Email the PDF combined with the notes. Not a .ppt file unless it contains critical animations or movies.
> Obey the 10/20/30 Rule of PowerPoint: 10 slides, 20 minutes, 30+ fonts
> Obsess about the product on your own time; present your business in all of its parts.

### Business Plans
> Business plans. Nobody reads them and nobody executes them. Investors who want a long plan look bad — so do companies that generate them.

**Don't send a long-ass business plan to VCs. You can write it for the company's sake, to build consensus within the team. But don't send that to VCs, they don't have the time, ever.**

### NDAs
Don't ask for an NDA -- investors won't sign one. So don't send anything confidential.

**Pros and Cons of sending decks**
- Pro: it might help you get a meeting.
- Con: it might lower the effectiveness of your electronic pitch
- Con: it can get in the hands of the competition

**When to send a deck**
- If you want the meeting more than they do, provide what they want. If they want a deck, give them a deck. 
- If they want the meeting more than you do, provide what you want.
- Write "Proprietary and Confidential, pls do not distribute. prepared for VC xxx" in the deck if you worry about leaking. Can also directly ask VC in writing to not distribute.
- If you don’t want to send your full deck, consider sending a teaser deck: an abridged deck that has just enough information to get a meeting.
- keep your secrets secret when you meet investors.
- you probably don't have many secrets though.

**Grockit Interview**
Two reasons why VCs don't invest
- you idea or business sucks and the VCs know it
- you suck at explaining it
> A referral is the single most powerful way to get into a VC firm.
- know at least one person connected to the VC world
- ask that person for more introductions
**Learning from raising Series A**
- most VCs are extremely smart, excited, positive, and insightful. They make the time we spent worth it on tis own.
> Make sure your pitch is great not good.
