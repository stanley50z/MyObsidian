### 1. Reciprocity 
The idea of giving someone a personalized and unexpected gift. People will feel like they own you because of social obligations.

The way to deliver this gift: helping people, publicly praising others, etc.

### 2. Scarcity
The less of something there is, the more people tend to want it. This is true for both material products as well as experiences.

Sometimes it's beneficial to make a product less available, or at least create a sense of scarcity.

### 3. Authority
Authority and credibility are important for building trust. When we trust people we are more likely to follow them.

It's better to build authority by someone else, not yourself, despite that who the other person is doesn't matter. So ask for recommendations, or better, recommend others so they have social obligations to give back.

### 4. Commitment and consistency
People are likely to be consistent with their self image. If I make you feel like you are a successful person, and say that successful person usually do this and buy that, you are more likely to follow.

Also, it can be an "one slice at a time" strategy. Introduce with a small offer, then make it a gateway to something else. This even applies for asking favors. If I ask you a small favor, the next time I ask you a bigger one, you tend to be consistent by doing it again.

### 5. Liking
Although this obvious, it's important that people like you. People will also like people who are more similar to them.

The key is that you need to get those likings before you try to influence someone. If you do it after, it won't work.

### 6. Consensus
People often look around to see what others are doing before making decisions. A good example is the "similar customers also like this...".
