Master List: [[Startup Readings Master List]]

This essay shares LinkedIn's pitch to help founder understand pitching. Keep in mind that LinkedIn is already pretty well established at this point. They want to prove that they are not a game player but a [[Frighteningly Ambitious Startup Ideas - Paul Graham|game changer]].

Before the pitch:
**Advice 1: understand your audience(investors). Know what they pay attention to.**
**Advice 2: understand the broader financing climate**
- for linkedIn, the investors regain interest in the consumer market, but they also are afraid of dot-com bubble. **Investors want to see solid revenue.**
Slide 0 is just cover with title
**Slide 1**
![[Pasted image 20240709183817.png|500]]
- Define the product - a network of people
- Why is it valuable - find people
- How is this different - through the people you already trust
**Advice: Open with your investment thesis**, which your investors must believe in order to invest. Explain in 3 - 8 bullet points.

**Slide 2**
![[Pasted image 20240709184657.jpg|500]]
Usually the second slide is to explain the product, but since investors here are concerned about revenue, this slide jumps directly to sources of revenue.
> **The general rule is one business model drives the business.** It’s tempting to list multiple revenue streams because you’re trying to prove that you will be big. Yet when consumer internet companies do this, investors generally see a red flag.
- You should consider how many ways to profit the company *should* have, and having just one is perfectly fine.

**Slide 3**
![[Pasted image 20240709202419.png|500]]
here come's the slide explaining the product. The slide points out the problems with the old "1.0" system.

**Advice: steer into your investors' objections**
Address the problems that they may have head on. Show that you understand their concerns, then you get their attention for the rest of the pitch.
- In LinkedIn's case, investors are concerned about if the company can make money

Slide 4
![[Pasted image 20240709204144.png|500]]
**Advice: Show, don't tell**
You are not really trying to be persuasive, but to bring investors to a shared view of the problem your company is addressing. You are trying to make investors more confident.

Slide 5
![[Pasted image 20240709204131.png|500]]
**Advice: Pitch by analogy** 
Time is short -- it helps to refer to past successful companies that investors already understand.

Slide 6
![[Pasted image 20240709204725.png|500]]
**Advice: understand where analogies apply and where they do not**
Pitch by analogy but don't necessarily reason by analogy.

Slide 7
![[Pasted image 20240709205006.png|500]]
**Advice: When pitching by analogy, anchor your business to other valuable businesses to signal that your business will be valuable, too**
- For LinkedIn, it's to show that networks enable revenue

Slide 8
![[Pasted image 20240709205309.png|500]]
**Advice: Avoid debating the validity of your analogies**
However, since so many founders use analogies, you need to make sure the analogy is **good**. **It's better to have no analogy than a bad one**

Slide 9
![[Pasted image 20240709205916.png|500]]
**Advice: Any good idea has legitimate reasons why it won’t work. *In order to achieve real success, you need to be contrarian and right***

Slide 10, 11
![[Pasted image 20240709210050.png|250]]![[Pasted image 20240709210100.png|250]]
These slides show the good, overdelivering track record from Series A.
**Advice: Your investment thesis is either concept-driven or data-driven**
- For data-driven, you show how the good the data already is.
- For concept-driven, it's more about how does the company reaches the future, so it depends on promised future data. This is why analogies are considered more often for concept-driven thesis.

Slide ???
**Advice: Explicitly identify the risks that could thwart your success and how you will mitigate them**
	This pitch is missing this slide but it's considered to be necessary nowadays.

Slide 14
![[Pasted image 20240709212457.png|500]]
**Advice: don't easily say that you have [[Lec 5 - Competition is for losers (Peter Thiel)|no competition]]**
	As great as it sounds, it's difficult to achieve, and it's a gradual process. You most likely will face competition along the way.
**Instead, clearly express your competitive advantage**
	show you understand the competitive risks and why you're going to win.

Slide 15
![[Pasted image 20240709213027.png|500]]
This is again not a really ideal slide, like slide 2
**Advice: customer slides are more appropriate for enterprise pitches**
	In this case, social networks need the common people to join, not the elite groups

Slide 16
![[Pasted image 20240709214003.png|500]]
**Advice: show some maneuverability, if plan A doesn't work out**
	Investors can appreciate this because you have thought about it.

Slide 17
![[Pasted image 20240709220557.png|500]]
**Advice: It's always better to have less slides, but it's much more important to have a great deck**
	A good deck addresses all important concerns and tell your story effectively.

Slide 18
![[Pasted image 20240709221131.png|500]]
**Advice: When pitching VCs, think about the individual partner in the context of their partnership**
	They are also telling you pitch to their partners. Give them the talking points.

Slide 19
![[Pasted image 20240709221509.png|500]]
**Advice**: People frequently think the most fundamental strategy of a startup is its product strategy. In fact, **the most fundamental strategy is the financing strategy**.
	Figure out that first.

Slide 20
![[Pasted image 20240709221632.png|500]]
**Advice: always think about the next round**

Slide 21
![[Pasted image 20240709222538.png|500]]
**Advice: Reinforce key concepts when delivering a concept pitch**
	Diagrams are helpful
**It’s helpful (but not mandatory) to put your thesis in each of the titles.**

Slide 22
![[Pasted image 20240709223012.png|500]]
**Advice: Show a focus on bottom-up tactics for your strategy**
	Instead of a top-down one

If you include a total addressable market(TAM) slide, don't stay on it for too long, because it shows that you don't understand the bottom-up concept

Slide 23
![[Pasted image 20240709223221.png|500]]
**Advice: show your product rather than saying you intend to build a best-of-breed product**
	again, show, not tell
	build it out, or at least have a mock up

Slide 24
![[Pasted image 20240709223616.png|500]]
**Advice: When in doubt, lead with what will make the most sense to investors**

Slide 25
![[Pasted image 20240709233953.png|500]]
**Advice: It’s more important to have the right person say yes than it is to have everyone say yes. Pay attention to whether they(investors) are being constructive during the financing process.**

Slide 26
![[Pasted image 20240709234138.png|500]]
**Advice: Internal data is preferable over anecdotal third party data**
**Talk to your network to evaluate your ideas and evaluate your pitch.**
	you learn valuable insight from smart people
**Be wary of confirmation bias.**
	When smart people consistently tell you about sth, listen

Slide 27
![[Pasted image 20240710001715.png|500]]

**Advice: Take competition against your potential revenue streams seriously**
	being detailed about your competition helps increase investor confidence.
**[[Lec 6 - Growth (Alex Schultz)|Identify the right metrics for success.]]**

**One of the virtues that entrepreneurs get from talking to many investors during the financing process is a wisdom of crowds that helps you figure out what the real risks are.**

Slide 30
![[Pasted image 20240710002747.png|500]]
**Advice: Be decisive and ship**
	You don't have to stick with your decisions, but do include specific dates to show decisiveness.
**While it’s important to think carefully about your future, don’t think too far into the future**

Slide 31
![[Pasted image 20240710003532.png|500]]
**Advice: be wary of adjectives and especially adverbs**
	Don't add them, it's overstating and weak.

Slide 32
![[Pasted image 20240710003707.png|500]]
**Advice: Have reasonable numbers and assumptions that can pass the blink test during the pitch.**
	let them quickly determine that you have a clear and reasonable understanding of your business model

slide 33
![[Pasted image 20240710004107.png|500]]
This is an appendix slide that normally you don't spend any time on. 
**Advice: A successful financing process obviously results in you raising capital for your company, but it also results in a partnership that delivers benefits beyond just money.**

Slide 34
![[Pasted image 20240710004342.png|500]]
**Advice: the team is important, but don't put them early in the deck**

Slide 35
![[Pasted image 20240710004713.png|500]]
Having a top-tier VC gives you more credits
**Advice: Approach your likely investors and your ideal investors at the same time, because your likely investors provide a temporal forcing function by which you might end up with your ideal investors.**
	by (likely investors) giving you an early offer that pressure the ideal investor to give you better terms
**Stay aboveboard so you keep trust with prospective investors.**
	tell them you are going to do this, i.e. talk to other investors

last slide
![[Pasted image 20240710005433.png|500]]
**Advice: You should end on a slide that you want people to be paying attention to** 
	close with your investment thesis
**Smart investors should add to your thinking about the investment thesis.**

### Appendix
> You don’t have to have an appendix, but if you anticipate serious questions from the kinds of investors you want, **preparing appendix slides with structured answers is impressive**, showing that you’ve considered all of your business’ challenges, opportunities, and comparisons. Appendix content typically fall under two categories: providing additional information or addressing objections.
