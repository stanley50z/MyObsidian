Master List: [[Startup Readings Master List]]

> If you're a startup and you don't have a close relationship with a few law firms you're really missing one of the most important relationships that any entrepreneur can have.

### 1. When to get a lawyer
Much earlier than you typically think - before you even register the company!
- agree exact equity splits when founders leave
- legal writing of ownership of IP created by contractors
- set up Stock Option Plan

### 2. I'll just have my cousin do it -- DON'T
Instead, lawyers that work with startups are willing to work on a deferred payment schedule.

They'll do it for startups with potential, so they lock in the client early. They usually ask for warrants (like a stock option) in exchange.

### 3. Additional value outside of legal documents
Lawyers can also be great network resources - since they know and might have worked with the other startups, VCs, and angels.

### 4. How to choose a lawyer
First, you need to pick a firm. Local, right sized, and startup focused.

**Local:** The benefit of working with a local firm is too big to ignore. They'll invite you out to events, develop a real mentorship relationship, not a paid one.

**Right sized:** If it's too big, their attention won't be on you. Likely you get assigned an unexperienced lawyer. The price is higher too.

**Startup Focused:** It doesn't have be a small firm either -- it just needs to be startup focused.

### 5. How to manage costs
The principle is to have no surprising additional costs. For "regular" stuff, ask for a fixed cost, unless sth totally unexpected happens. Let your lawyers earn, but make it competitive.

Also, they are many things you can do yourself, so don't waste money on those.

### 6. Traps to look out for
- Make the partners to do the work. They can get things done in less hours despite having a higher hourly cost. That being said, it's also important to know the associate and if they are good.
- Lawyers don't help you get good deals. They NEVER explain to you just how certain terms can be used to screw you in the future. **So you need to understand the terms.** Resource: [term sheet](https://feld.com/archives/2005/08/term-sheet-series-wrap-up/)
- Lawyers are your support staff, not your brain. Think over the decisions by yourself first, and then ask lawyers about risks.

### 7. The good guys

>  [Giff Constable](http://twitter.com/giffconstable) has started a great national list [here](http://giffconstable.com/web-startup-lawyers-list/). It’s an awesome service to entrepreneurs, thank you. TrueVentures goes one step further with a broader recommendation list [here](http://www.trueventures.com/recommendations/) (I hope to add this tab to our website in our next rev. True is always one step ahead of the curve) My additions below:

- I’ve already covered David Young at DLA Piper. He mostly covers Southern California.
- I really had a great experience with Sam Angus at Fenwick & West when I lived in Silicon Valley.
- I have worked extensively with [Scott Alderton](http://www.biztechlaw.com/attorneys/Alderton_Scott.html) (yes, he was having a bad hair day in the picture on the link!) of Stubbs Alderton, a firm that focused exclusively on early-stage tech, media and game companies in Southern California. They have a stellar reputation and know how to work with the earliest of starts with entrepreneurs.
- If you’re doing litigation work and want one of the best national firms who will work on a contingency arrangement (e.g. much of their fees are paid only if they win) then check out [Steven Sklaver](http://www.susmangodfrey.com/?id=186) over at Sussman Godfrey. Disclosure: he’s my cousin. And he’s also a Cowboys fan. But if you can stomach that he’s a star and contingency work / risk sharing on IP claims is key!
- [Don Lee](http://www.buchalter.com/bt/index.php?action=Show&AttyID=68&option=com_content&task=view&id=152&Itemid=134) at Buchalter Nemer was referred to me by [Todd Gitlin](http://www.safirepartners.com/about_us.html) and came on very high recommendations as an early-stage, true entrepreneur’s perfect lawyer because he understands how to work with startups.
- On later stage LA Tech M&A deals I’ve heard there’s none better than David Hernand of Gibson Dunn
- In Silicon Valley the name I hear mentioned most often for very early stage deals is Joey Tran from Fortis. He represented us at one firm I invested in and did a great job.
- We’ve had great experiences with Michael Pfau in Santa Barbara.
- I never met a person who didn’t talk about Mike Lincoln of Cooley Godward in DC.
- Anyone who does IP law in Southern California seems to use [Knobbe Martens](http://www.kmob.com/)
