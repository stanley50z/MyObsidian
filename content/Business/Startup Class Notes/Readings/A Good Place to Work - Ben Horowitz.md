It's important for the CEO to train employees and executives. Not only what to do, but **why to do**.

If the company is facing a challenge and doesn't look too good, the only reason that people stay is that they like the job. 
1. Being a good company doesn't matter when things go well, but it can be the difference between life and death when things go wrong.
2. Things always go wrong.
3. Being a good company is itself an end.

> When Steve came into my office I asked him a question: “Steve, do you know why I came to work today?”
> 
> Steve: “What do you mean, Ben?”
> 
> Me: “Why did I bother waking up? Why did I bother coming in? If it was about the money, couldn’t I sell the company tomorrow and have more money than I ever wanted? I don’t want to be famous, in fact just the opposite. ”
> 
> Steve: “I guess.”
> 
> Me: “Well, then why did I come to work.”
> 
> Steve: “I don’t know.”
> 
> Me: “Well, let me explain. I came to work, because it’s personally very important to me that Opsware be a good company. It’s important to me that the people who spend 12 to 16 hours/day here, which is most of their waking life, have a good life.  It’s why I come to work.”
> 
> Steve: “OK.”
> 
> Me: “Do you know the difference between a good place to work and a bad place to work?”
> 
> Steve: “Umm, I think so.”
> 
> Me: “What is the difference?”
> 
> Steve: “Umm, well…”
> 
> Me: “Let me break it down for you. In good organizations, people can focus on their work and have confidence that if they get their work done, good things will happen for both the company and them personally. It is a true pleasure to work in an organization such as this. Every person can wake up knowing that the work they do will be efficient, effective and make a difference both for the organization and themselves. These things make their jobs both motivating and fulfilling.
> 
> “In a poor organization, on the other hand, people spend much of their time fighting organizational boundaries, infighting and broken processes. They are not even clear on what their jobs are, so there is no way to know if they are getting the job done or not. In the miracle case that they work ridiculous hours and get the job done, they have no idea what it means for the company or their careers. To make it all much worse and rub salt in the wound, when they finally work up the courage to tell management how fucked up their situation is, management denies there is a problem, then defends the status quo, then ignores the problem.”
> 
> Steve: “OK.”
> 
> Me: “Are you aware that your manager Tim has not met with any of his employees in the past six months?”
> 
> Steve: “No.”
> 
> Me: “Now that you are aware, do you realize that there is no possible way for him to even be informed as to whether or not his organization is good or bad?”
> 
> Steve: “Yes.”
> 
> Me: “In summary, you and Tim are preventing me from achieving my one and only goal. You have become a barrier blocking me from achieving my most important goal.  As a result, if Tim doesn’t meet with each one of his employees in the next 24 hours, I will have no choice but to fire him and to fire you. Are we clear?”
> 
> Steve: “Crystal.”
