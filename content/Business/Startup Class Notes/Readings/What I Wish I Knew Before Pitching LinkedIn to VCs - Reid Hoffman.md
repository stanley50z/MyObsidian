Master List: [[Stanford Startup Course Master List]]

Mostly a summary of [[LinkedIn’s Series B Pitch to Greylock - Reid Hoffman]]

**1.**  
**MYTH: The startup financing process is about one thing — money.**  
**TRUTH: A successful financing process results in a partnership that delivers benefits beyond just money.**

> How do you know if an investor will add value? Pay attention to whether they are being constructive during the pitch and financing process. Do they understand your market? Are their questions the same questions that keep you up at night? Are you learning from their feedback? Are they passionate about the problem you’re trying to solve?

**2.**  
**MYTH: If your team is strong, show the team slide early in your pitch.**  
**TRUTH: Open your pitch with the investment thesis.**
- Business thesis >> team
**3.**  
**MYTH: All investment pitches have the same structure.**  
**TRUTH: Decide whether your pitch is a data pitch or a concept pitch.**
- data pitch is data, concept pitch is vision of the future(and not data)
**4.**  
**MYTH: Avoid bringing up anything that might paint your business as risky and decrease investors’ confidence.**  
**TRUTH: Identify and steer into your risk factors.**
- and how you plan to respond
**5.**  
**MYTH: Arguing that you have no prospective competitors is a strength.  
TRUTH: Acknowledge all types of competition and express your competitive advantage.**
- same
**6.  
MYTH: Don’t compare yourself to other companies because you think you’re unique.  
TRUTH: Pitch by analogy.**
- by using familiar examples, but don't reason by analogy
**7.**  
**MYTH: Focus on today’s pitch. The future will take care of itself.  
TRUTH: Think also about the round after the one you’re currently raising.**
- so when presenting, carefully choose milestones and make sure to achieve them before the next round
