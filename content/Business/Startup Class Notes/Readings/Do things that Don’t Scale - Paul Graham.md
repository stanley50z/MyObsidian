[[Startup Readings Master List]]
###### recruit users manually
- "But for a startup to succeed, at least one founder (usually the CEO) will have to spend a lot of time on sales and marketing."
	Don’t ignore this because the initial number is small
- Don dismiss your own company because it seems fragile at the beginning. Evaluate the future of the company as if things are done right
###### initial user experience 
- Go out there and do extreme measures to make sure **the user is happy**
	this may no seem to worth it at first, but there’s nothing to lose
	it will will make up the difference when your initial product is buggy and incomplete
- Steve Jobs: your attention to the users should be “insanely great”

###### initial market
- build product for a niche subset of a market, and gain critical mass of initial users from there
	many startup do this unconsciously: they build the product for themselves and friends, and only later realize that the product can go into a bigger market

###### Meraki - hardware startup
- hardware startup faces an obstacle that software startup doesn't. The initial physical product requires hundred of thousands of dollar if ordering from factories. 
- "Pulling a Meraki" means to build the first few products by yourself by hand.
	building the product yourself can also make you tweak the design faster

###### Do things manually
- It's okay(easy to get away with when you only have a few users) to do things manually that you plan to implement later.
	it's better to actually solve the problem first than to have sth. automatic but doesn't work well

###### Big launch
- "the Big Launch" usually doesn't work.
	**all you need from a launch are some initial core of users. It's more important to make them happy than to have more of them**
- Recruiting users is a gradual process: you can't get them all at once
- Partnerships with a big company usually don't work as well
	It's a lot of work, and you practically get nothing out of it

###### Vector
Treat your startup as a vector with two component: one scalable and one unscalable. You have to the unscalable laborious part, and you have to make a lot of effort doing it. It permanently improved the company
