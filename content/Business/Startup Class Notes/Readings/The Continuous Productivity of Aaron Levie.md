Problem identified: Documents are some of the most valuable asset that a company has, yet they are increasingly being stored on personal devices and third-party services. This risks important confidential documents getting leaked.

**Competitors**
Microsoft: struggling to catch up the rise of cloud and mobile computing.
Dropbox: more focused on the consumer side, not enterprise side.

So, despite having only 1/10 of the users, Box can still prevail.

**Features**
In addition, Box adds notes feature to foster communication. It's easier when it's integrated into the file system.

However, since hard disks get cheaper and cheaper, Box risks being replaced by free online storage from Google, Apple, etc. 

Since many Boxâ€™s users are business users, Box strengthens their advantage by adding features like search, security, access permissions, etc.

Consumer product like Dropbox got great success as mobile platforms get popular since 2007, the debut of iPhone. But Box didn't back down, and instead double down on the integration of file storage and display of information. Low friction info-sharing is the key.

Additionally, the software becomes more tailored toward specific industry's need.
