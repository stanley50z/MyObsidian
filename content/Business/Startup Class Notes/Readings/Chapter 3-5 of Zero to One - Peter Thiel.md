# Startups should always aim for monopoly.

### Preface
>In a world of gigantic administrative bureaucracies both public and private, searching for a new path might seem like hoping for a miracle. Actually, if American business is going to succeed, we are going to need hundreds, or even thousands, of miracles. **This would be depressing but for one crucial fact: humans are distinguished from other species by our ability to work miracles. *We call these miracles technology.***
### Chapter 3: All happy companies are different
Definition: by "monopoly", the book mean the kind of company that's so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute.

> The lesson for entrepreneurs is clear: *if you want to create and capture lasting value, don't build an undifferentiated commodity business*.

There basically two types of companies: monopoly and competitive.
**Monopoly lies to protect themselves**
- Bragging about market share invites regulation
- Google takes 68% of the search engine market, but if you see Google as an advertising company, then it's only 3.4% of the global advertising market.
**Competitive Lies to feel special**
- Competitive companies pretend to be "in a league of their own" to avoid the competitive nature of the market they are in.
- Jay-Z starring in a cross between *Hackers* and *Jaws* is certainly special, but no one will like it.

**Ruthless Competition**
Competition forces businesses to focus on their margins ruthlessly, which may push them to pay lower wages, use inferior materials, or some other unmoral ways to cut cost.
In contrast, a monopoly like Google don't have to worry about competition and their own survival, so it has wider latitude to care about its workers, its products, and its impact on the wider world. 

> In business, *money is either an important thing or it is everything.* Monopolists can afford to think about things other than making money; non-monopolists can't.

*Insight: 联想到了国内为什么国企“舒服”而私企却很“卷”。为什么外企“舒服”而中小厂“卷”。联想到了国内因竞标导致的用劣质材料的豆腐渣工程。*

**Monopoly Capitalism**
You can say monopoly is harmful to the rest of the society **only if nothing changes**. And that's true.
- Our world is dynamic. Monopoly brings positive change to the society.
- Monopolies holding back progress will be replaced by better monopolies.
> But the history of progress is a history of better monopoly businesses replacing incumbents.
- The monopoly profit incentivize companies to make long-term, large-scale commitment to researches and projects. Competitive firms can't dream of this.
> In business, equilibrium means stasis, and stasis means death.
> *Monopoly is the condition of every successful business*

### Chapter 4: The Ideology of Competition
Society decides that competition isn't just some inconvenience created by the market, **competition is *the* ideology of our society, a bad one.**
> We preach competition, internalize its necessity, and enact its commandments; and as a result, we trap ourselves within it––even though the more we compete, the less we gain.

*Critiques on the education system*
- Grades(and rankings) precisely show how competitive you are. High grades are honored, low grades are shamed.
- The purpose of chasing high grades and "spots" feel baseless the deeper you get.
> - Elite students climb confidently until they reach a level of competition sufficiently intense to beat their dreams out of them

**War and Peace**
> It's competition, not business, that is like war: allegedly necessary, supposedly valiant, but ultimately destructive

In business, people are obsessed with competition within, and firms are obsessed with competing against each other.

In competition, you lose track of purpose and stop innovating(and start aggressively copying).
> Winning is better than losing, but everybody loses when the war isn't one worth fighting.

### Chapter 5: Last Mover Advantage
Business is evaluated as the sum of all future cash flows.

<u>Business often focus on the growth but neglect endurance.</u>

**Characteristics of Monopoly**
1. Proprietary Technology
	Proprietary technology should be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute in some important dimensions 
> The clearest way to make 10x improvement is to invent something completely new.
2. Network Effects
	Network effects make a product more useful as more people use it.
	However, your products should be valuable to the initial small group of users, or it will never reach that many users to have the network effect.
3. Economies of Scale
	A monopoly business gets stronger as it gets bigger. A good startup should have the potential for great scale built into its first design.
4. Branding
	Creating a strong brand is a powerful way to claim a monopoly. 
	Branding is on top of other monopoly advantages, not within.
> No technology company can be built on branding alone.

**Building a Monopoly**
*Start Small and Monopolize*
> Every startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. *Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market*
- Small doesn't mean non-existent though.
- The perfect target market is a small group of particular people concentrates together and served by few or no competitors.

*Scaling Up*
> Once you create and dominate a niche market, then you should gradually expand into relates and slightly broader markets.
- Amazon start with books, then CDs, videos, software.
- eBay start as online auction house for niche hobby enthusiasts.
	- However, eBay faces the hidden problem of scaling: auctions work for collectibles, not commodities.

*Don't disrupt*
If the technology is in fact disruptive, sure. But don't interpret your company as purely a disruptor: a good startup would create far more than it disrupt.
> If your company can be summed up by its opposition to already existing firms, it can't be completely new and it's probably not going to become a monopoly.
