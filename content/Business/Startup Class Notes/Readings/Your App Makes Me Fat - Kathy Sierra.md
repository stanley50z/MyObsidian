> Willpower and cognitive processing draw from the _same_ pool of resources.

If you deplete the "tank" through a lot of cognitive processing, the willpower of continuing would be low.

**This applies to product design as well, the more you make users to make conscious choices, the less energy they're left with to deal with reality.**

> If your app is confusing and your tech support / FAQ isn’t helpful, you’re drawing down my scarce, precious, cognitive resources. If your app behaves counter-intuitively – even just _once_ – I’ll leak cog resources _every time I use it, forever,_ wondering, “wait, did that do what I expected?”.

The author advocates for better choices considering the apps can significantly drain the cognitive processing tank.

> This is NOT about consuming their time and attention _while_ they’re using your app. This is about draining their ability for logical thinking, problem-solving, and willpower _after_ the clicking/swiping/gesturing is done.

> But if it’s “content” designed solely to suck people in (“7 ways to be OMG awesome!!”)  for the chance to “convert”, we’re _hurting_ people. If we’re pumping out “content” because _frequency,_ we’re _hurting_ people. I’m hurting some of you now. That’s on me. It’s why I try to use graphics to make the key point, so you don’t have to _read_ the post (also because I’m really rambly-aroundy, I know, workin’ on it.)

>My father died unexpectedly last week, and as happens when one close to us dies, I had the “on their deathbed, nobody thinks…” moment. Over the past 20 years of my work, I’ve created interactive marketing games, gamified sites (before it was called that), and dozens of other projects carefully, artfully, _scientifically_ designed to slurp (_gulp_) cognitive resources for… _very little that was “worth it”._  Did people willingly choose to engage with them? Of course. And by “of course” I mean, _not really, no_. Not according to psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral economics research of the past 50 years. They were nudged/seduced/_tricked_. And I was pretty good at it. I am so very, very sorry.
