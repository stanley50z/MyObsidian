Master List: [[Stanford Startup Course Master List]]


Basically, think of the company and employees as an alliance.
- a mutually beneficial deal
- with explicit terms
- between independent players

Employees are **allies** on a **tour of duty**
- rotational: entry-level employees
- foundational: employees as part of the company's intellectual and emotional core
- transformational: personalized transformation for both the company and employee

**Build trust incrementally, as each side proves itself**

Both sides can afford to invest in each other for better payoffs long-term
- this is why it's important to explicitly state the career benefits for your employees.
- explicit means skill-wise and time-wise
