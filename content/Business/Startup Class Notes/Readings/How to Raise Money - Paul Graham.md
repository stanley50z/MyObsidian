Master List: [[Startup Readings Master List]]

A typical trajectory of raising money is like this:
1. Get start with a few 10Ks from seth like YC or angels
2. Raise with a few 100Ks~Ms to build the company
3. Once the company is clearly succeeding, raise more round(s) to accelerate growth

*This essay focuses on the 2nd step*

#### Forces
> The ultimate source of the forces acting on you are the forces acting on investors.

The investors have two kinds of fear:
1. Fear of investing startups that fail
2. Fear of missing out on startups that take off

So the best strategy is for them to wait and see if the situation is about taking off, but not too long because then it would be too late.

>**Don't raise money unless you want it and it wants you**

The way to evaluate here is if you have rapid growth, when you do, it's usually that
1. you can use the money to grow faster
2. you can easily get invested because of your rapid growth

Don't raise money if you can't convince the investors yet.

> **Be in fundraising mode or not**
- because fundraising is distracting, finish it and get back to work

When you're not in fundraising mode, don't take investment, unless:
- It takes ZERO effort to convince them
- the terms are good that you can just take without judging much
	- About this, one danger here is too high of a evaluation, because it makes it difficult to raise next round.
