Aaron Levie is the founder and CEO of Box.

Identifies trends:
- Cost of storage dropping dramatically
- More powerful browsers and networks
- More locations and people to share with

 The business model problem:
 - Consumers have a robust product, but they don't want to pay for more features
 - Enterprise need security and management feature that Box doesn't have.

As the fundamental base of consumers transfer to smart phones, every industry is changing. Every enterprise needs new software to empower their products, sales, etc.

**Spot disruptions**
- Look for new enabling technologies that create a wide gap between how things have been done and how they can be done.
- Confirms with this [[How to Get Startup Ideas - Paul Graham]], what used to be a bad idea may become viable due to new technology.

**Intentionally start small**
- and then grow big

**Find Asymmetries**
Do things that incumbents can't or won't do because it's economically or technically infeasible.

**Listen to customers**
But don't always build exactly what they want. Build what they need.

**Focus on the user**
Keep the "consumer" DNA

**Your product should sell itself**
Sales should be used to navigate customers and close deals, not be a substitute for great product.
