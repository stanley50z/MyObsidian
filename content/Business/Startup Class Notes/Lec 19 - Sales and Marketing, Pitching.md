### Prospecting - Who can be interested
- **Find the innovators (2.5%)**
- It's numbers game!
- Network / Conferences(go to gathering of your customers) / Cold Emails(be concise)

### Conversations
- do more listening and less talking
- **Religious Follow Up** - time is valuable, sometimes a clear 'no' is better than a 'maybe'

### Closing
- close deals quickly, don't go back and forth on details
**When told 'I would buy if you have this one more feature**:
- Usually a polite pass
- building it will not get you the sale
- So either: 
	- Sign a conditional agreement
	- wait to hear demand from more customers
**When asked 'Free Trials':**
- You need commitment, validation, and revenue
- instead, do refunds for the first x days

==========================================
### Pitching
You need a 30-second pitch, you need a 2-minute pitch. You don't need a 10, 30 minutes pitch.

**30 second pitch - three sentences**
- What does your company do?
	No pre-information needed, basic language, explainable to your mom
- How big is the market?
	Spent some time researching on this
- How much traction do you have?
	Sales, growth, customers. prove that you are moving fast

**2 minute pitch**
- your 30 second pitch
- **Unique** insight(2 sentences)
	How you can kill competitors
	ah-ha moment
- **How** you make money
	Don't shy away from it. Just say it.
- **Team**
	Past impressive things
	how many, how many are technical, how long you've met
	if full-time or not
	not academic achievement, PhD, etc.
- **The big ask(\$\$\$)**
	Know your numbers
	Transferable Notes? SAFE?

**When to Fundraise**
- when you have traction
- when investors are asking to invest

**How to Setup Investor Meetings**
- Warm Intros: referrals from other entrepreneurs/past investors
- Go FAST when fundraising
- trick: say the first two weeks are busy for building, and schedule every investor meeting in the third week.

**Avoid Common mistakes**
- make sure the listener understands what you're working on
- know your numbers
- bottom up analysis on market size
- understand something that is counter intuitive
- your team should be uniquely suited for the business

**Hallmarks of a good pitch**
- Capture interest, tell an interesting story, engage with the listener 
- Demonstrate insights and command of the market, passionate not dismissive
- Collaborative meeting more than an interrogation
- actually ask for money

**After the meeting**
- Follow up: anything not a direct payment is a 'No'
- Work on creating deal heat (supply / demand)
- Do diligence on the investors
- know when to stop
- build your company! (more important than fundraising)
