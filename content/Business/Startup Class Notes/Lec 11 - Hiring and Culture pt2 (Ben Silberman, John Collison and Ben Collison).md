Ben Silberman - Pinterest
John Collison and Ben Collison - Stripe

**Q&A**
What are the most important pieces of culture when building your company?
	Ben: 
	1. Who do we hire and what do those people value
	2. What do we do everyday? Why?
	3. What do we choose to communicate?
	4. What we choose to celebrate?
	Stripe:
	Internal transparency.

How to hire the first ten employees?
	Ben: 
	Inductive. I hire people that I want to work with. We hire people that are like ourselves. 
	Creative, quirky people tend to build great products and be great team members.
	Wanting to build something great is a good sign for early employees. You are likely not going to be offer better things.
	Stripe:
	We try to use [[How to Hire - Sam Altman|personal connections]], like through friends of friends, etc.
	One common thing is that our first hires are early in their careers/undervalued in some way.
	Another thing is that they are often very genuine and straight.
	They also look forward to finish things.
	They care a great deal. 

**Good people are usually working on something, so you have to go seek them out.** Especially if you are working something new.

How do inexperienced founders judge if someone is great or not?
	Ben: 
	ask what traits the world class people use to identify. This sense should develop over time.  
	be transparent about the amazing opportunities to work on this difficult problem. 
	Stripe:
	[[How to Hire - Sam Altman|Trial them to do work]] and let them explain what they are doing. 

How do you get people to start working effectively fast?
	Remind them of future plans. Don't sink them into the small problems they are currently work.
	Get them to do real work, only this would show their effectiveness.
	Quickly give them feedback, especially for adapting into the culture. 

What are the biggest changes you have to make as the company grow?
	Give the team as much autonomy as possible so they don't feel the " structure"
	As for the hiring process, we get more and more referrals
	As you grow, you think into the future further.

Are the early hires able to transition into leadership rolesï¼Ÿ
	 Stripe: yes, Pinterest: some yes and some no. Engineers can also be influential just through their individual contribution.
	 It's not easy to predict, so give everyone a fair shot

How has the vision changed since we initially started?
	Looking at the collection of others is a great way to discover things that you didn't know you were looking for.

**How to do you convince people to make sacrifices to join a startup?**
	The risk of failing is also the exciting part--you aren't guaranteed a success. People who are willing to take this risk to build sth exciting is the ones you want anyways.
	Startups do generally have super long working hours at the beginning. But it's somewhat overstated. 
	State that the employee's influence will be much more in a start-up, so they can view it as a personal experience.
	**Red flag: interviewee is apply jobs for other unrelated companies. This generally shows that they are here for the experience, not achievements. They tend to back down when problem arises.**

How has your user base changed your hiring strategy?
	We generally look for the ones ambitious and believe in the vision. They usually should be an user of the product, but if they aren't, what's the barrier? And they can join in and remove that barrier.
	Again, find people who are passionate about your products.
