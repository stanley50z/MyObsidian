How to keep track of productivity system?
	I keep one piece of paper with my goals for 3-12 months time frame, and I look at it everyday. I also keep one piece of paper of short-term goal for the day.
	I also keep a list of people, what they are working on, what I need to talk to them about, what we talked about last time.

Most startup fails. How to fail gracefully?
	You don't want a blowup. You talk to your investors, and don't run completely out of money. Don't surprise people.

Good places to do startup besides SV?
	I still think SV is the best by a significant margin. Seattle, LA, international.

When to hire a professional CEO?
	Never. If you don't want to run the company long-term, you probably shouldn't start it. Maybe contradicts [[If, Why, and How Founders Should Hire a "Professional" CEO]]

Excited about a market but don't know much about it, what do I do?
	A) Jump right in and learn it as you go, B) work at a company in the field. I slightly lean toward B, but both would work as long as you pay attention to the users.

When should a group of founders raise seed money?
	It's nice to wait until you have the idea figure out and have some initial signs of promise.
