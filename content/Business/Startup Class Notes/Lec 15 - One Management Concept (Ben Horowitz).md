> **When making a critical decision, you must understand how it will be interpreted from each person's point of view and its impact on the union of the individual views. i.e. culture**

### 1. Demotions
*"Do you demotion or fire?"*
**Your perspective**
- tough to fire someone
- demotion is hard to swallow
- impact in company's culture
**The employee's perspective**
- may not want the demotion, but at least that's an option
- saves the embarrassment of getting fires
- enables him to keep growing with the company
**The other employees' perspective**
- Does he keep his same equity package?
- Is he going to work as hard being the guy who reports to the guy?
- Do I have any respect for him now that he's been demoted?

### 2. Raise
**Your perspective**
- you want to keep the employee
- they have done great work, so it's â€œfair"
- you'll like each other more
**The employee's perspective**
- I deserve that raise
**The other employees' perspective**
- unfair that I didn't get a raise
- I did better work, so doubly unfair
- Maybe I should quit
**Culture**
- Every employee feel a responsibility to ask for a raise all the time
***Right Answer***
- Formal performance evaluation process
- All the right inputs
- Run as frequently as needed
- No raised outside of the process

### 3. Sam Altman's blog
 Typical practice: within 90 days of leaving the company, you either buy the stock back(exercise), or lose it. I you stay in the company, you can keep the stock(sometimes gradually) after x years(vest).
Propose practice: extend that exercise period to 10 years.
**Your perspective**
- you want to be fair
- Don't want employees to stay who don't want to be there, but feel handcuffed
- want to reward people who stay
**The leaving employee's perspective**
- I worked for my shares; I shouldn't be prevented from getting them due to economics
- Did you tell me the truth when you hired me? If you didn't, I'll make sure that everyone know that
- If I was fired, I just got screwed a second time
**The staying employee's perspective**
- Is is smarter for me to stay or leave economically?
-  Are my colleagues being treated fairly?
- Does my loyalty matter?
**Situation Analysis**
- Companies @SV lose 10% of employees per year
- SV companies dilute at 6-8% per year when they are private for employee comp
- If an employee doesn't exercise the stock, it goes back to the pool where it can be reissued to new or existing employees. 
- Losing all your stock is a big financial risk
- a 10 year option on a highly volatile security is quite valuable
- When the employee goes to the new company, she gets the new company stock plus the 10 year option
- The employee who stays gets the option only
**Two alternative cultural statements**
- treat new employees with the utmost straight-forwardness and fairness. 10 year exercise period.
- tell up front that you must (a)vest, (b) stay until exit or have the cash to exercise, (c) make the company worth something

**Example 1: conquer the enemy - what to do with the conquered soldiers?**
	not to pillage - longer vision for the culture
	take them into the team
**Example 2: what to do with the slave owners?**

### Conclusion
It's not your perspective or the perspective of the person that you are talking to at the moment that matters. You must consider the people who are not in the room. 

They are the company. They are the culture.

**Q&A**
If you're gonna fire someone, how do you make the conversation? How do you explain that to others?
	Be honest. It's likely that the mistake happens when hiring, a mismatch between the job and the employee, so start with that.
	For explaining to other employees, it's just best say thank you for their past work and that they have moved on.

How do you deal with the stress of being a CEO?
	Keep your focus on what you can do, not what is happening to you.
	(Get a supportive wife)

How do you get people who are previously against your side?
	Show them a better way. 

What makes a16z stand out?
	All of our partners are founder-CEOs
	build a network around the CEO, not bringing in a CEO that has one
