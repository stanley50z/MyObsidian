### **Q&A**
How to you balance between firing fast and making early employees feel secure when they screwed up?
	Once you know an employee is not working out, it's usually not the first few times. It'll be painfully obvious.

How to do equity split between founders?
	It should be near equal.

What if the co-founder relationship fall apart?
	Set up vesting. 

How do you choose between hiring a mediocre employee and losing customers?
	Early on, I would say lose the customers. Later, it depends.

Working remote?
	Don't do it. It isn't impossible to do it, but it's really really tough.
