Q&A
There are different types of users, how do you build a product that all users love?
	Focus on the people who are the most passionate. Then you will figure out the universal value
	Focus on **top priorities like ease of use**, anything else is polish

How do you make decisions on product development?
	Again, user feedbacks. We can quickly know if a product is good or not. Don't *always* listen to what the users are suggesting, but figure the underlying problems. 
	It's also dangerous to have multiples tracks of development that all take a lot of time

What's 'King for a day'?
	Someone is randomly assigned to be the King. The King tells everyone else what to do on the product. 

You started out doing remote only? That's usually terrible, how did you manage that?
	Respect people's time. All meetings are done on Friday, and one day you are customer support duty. That leaves three workdays per week.
	'15 minutes rule': you can some discussion, but not longer than 15 minutes. If it can't be solved, bring it to the Friday meetings.
	*It takes disciplines, it's hard to pull off.*

How to you set up accountabilities for employees as a manager?
	Incentive is bonuses, based on metrics.
	The only thing we use to boost efficiency is shared and time-tracked to-do lists. By going over the task listed and done, it's easy to track it down and correct wrongdoings quickly. 

How to you hire people that can work remotely?
	One way is to try them out. Contract them out and let them work on a side project for a month.
	The other way is to let them try customer support.

Say one trick that fail to support the company.
	"Crunch Mode": a contest to see who complete the to-do list faster. It's demoralizing for the person about to lose, so don't do it.
