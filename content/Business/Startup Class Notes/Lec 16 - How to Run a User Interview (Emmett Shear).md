**Who you choose to interview is just at important as how you ask the questions**

**Interview**
- Stay away from asking about features
	- Users sometimes don't know what the problem is/if there is one.
- Talk to different extremes of people, 6~8 interviews for each kind is usually good enough
**Afterthought**
- What features would I add that **make the user switch to mine?**

> "the money test": People's feedback a lot more serious when they paid for it.

**Users vs. Non-Users**
It's often more important to hear from non-users: what stop them from becoming users? **That's what would stop you from expanding**

**Q&A**
What are the most common mistakes about user interviews?
	Showing your product. Don't do it, same for telling them about a feature. Don't ask people if they want to use/buy product/feature
	Only talking to those available, not having diversity.

How hard is it to get buy-in within the company?
	Recording interviews so you can show it to the company. 

So on that, do you insist on doing interviews should Skype for example?
	Generally, you don't want to do interview through emails. 

What channels do you use to reach out to users, and do you compensate them?
	On-site chat channels, send emails, go to events(know people, not interview at the event). We don't compensate people because we want users who care enough without compensation.

On-site user feedback tools. Thoughts?
	They are super important. It helps with what you are doing, but not where you are going.

What group of users should you focus on first?
	The users of the competing products. They are already interest in the category, we just need to make them switch, which is much easier than converting non-users. 
	It's also important that the range of users that interest you shifts over time. So you should keep doing interviews and talking to new users.

How do give good user feedback as a user?
	Be honest about thinkings and feelings.
	Give more context about the user itself, so you understand where they are coming from.
