Q&A
What makes you invest?
- [[LinkedInâ€™s Series B Pitch to Greylock - Reid Hoffman|The first minute]], I decide if this person is a leader. Is this person rifled, focused, and obsessed by the product?
- I then ask the first question: what inspires you? I want to see that it's inspired a personal problem, and the company is the solution.
- Then, I look for communication skills. 

> **The Venture Capital business is 100% a game of outliers**
- 200 get funded, 15 eventually go to 100M revenue.
- you either are one of them or not
> **Invest in strength vs lack of weakness**
- The winners usually have some extremely good strength, with a tolerable set of weakness

**Practice over and over the one sentence that explains what the product does**

**Once you built a great product, then it's about execution and building a great team**

**Still, building a better product, hiring a good team, is much harder and important**

## Have a clear plan of future milestones
#### Mistakes when raising capital
**Risk and Cash**
Make milestones, where you both:
- eliminate some layers of risks
- justify raising more capital
**Don't make investors sign NDAs**
- It's a sign of distrust
**Do get things in writing**
- Do it as quickly and efficiently as you possibly can
- when investors make a commitment, get it down in writing, like email stating what they just said.

#### Pre-Seeds, Round A
pre-Seeds: 
- find a good angel investors that can give you the right introductions and referrals to other investors.
- sell about 10-15% of equity

Round A: 
- have a seed round first before round A
- sell about 20-30% of equity

**How do you know what the right evaluation is?**
	A rough range for round A is below 10M. Don't raise more than you need.

**Q&A**
Does raising money help you make the exit or acqui-hire?
	Yes... but its the good investors who help. You shouldn't be thinking about exits when raising money.

What are bad signs of investors?
- no domain expertise
- no connections and introductions
- feel respectable after talking to them(investors)

What are the constraints for VC?
- conflicting companies
	You invest in Facebook, then you can't invest in MySpace
- time and bandwidth
	How long it takes to invest

What makes investors invest in company without a product?
- some capital-intensive companies need money to even build the first product. It's okay to not have a MVP in that case since you want to ship the full product to the users anyways.
- **However, since there's no product, it'll depend on if the founders are good or not, like having good track record, known, famous, etc**

Opinions on Board Structure?
- I wouldn't worry too much about investors air-dropping CEOs and Admins and destroy the company. Decisive board votes usually don't happen.
- It depends on how good the company is going.
- If it's going good, founder has control, if it's bad, investors have control.
