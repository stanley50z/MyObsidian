### Manager = Editor
1. Editing(simplify)
There should only one or two precise things to do. Cut down the others. "This is just complex" is not an excuse.
2. Clarify
Ask a lot of clarifying questions.
3. Allocate Resources
Point to general directions, but let journalists come up with their own initiatives. A good indicator is that you edit less and less.
4. Ensure Consistent Voice
Make company feel consistent at all fronts: PR, Hiring, Product Launch
5. Delegate
When at low confidence of "you being right" and small consequence, delegate.
When at high confidence and massive consequence, take charge.
6. Editing the team
Slowly push more responsibilities and complexities to the employees, until they break.
Another indicator is how often other employees go to the office of an employee that they don't report to. It's a good sign that that employee can handle more responsibilities.

### Insist on Focus
People tend to solve less difficult problems. Insisting on focus can force people solve the one difficult but important problem.

### Gathering & Simplifying Information
- Goal: predict output to enable you to adjust
- Should measure output, not activity
- Pair indicators, don't just use one because it may compromise on the other indicators.
### Details
Push for perfections on **every** detail. Not just the ones facing the users, **every** detail.
- What food you serve
- Choosing the office
- ...

### Effort
How do you do the transparent compensation?
	Bands, so pay by roles, experiences, etc. But similar people the same wage.

What kind of details people usually care about?
	An example is the machine they are given. You want to give the best possible tool for people to do the best possible job.

How do you allocate resources when it's typically scarce for startups?
	First of all, you should have your own office. Shared office space is BS. Start from there and build a culture

What are the best ways to get street credits as a new manager?
	Most of the time, you would promote people to managers, so they would already have the credits. 
	This way, employee don't hold grudges as well because they know their managers are better at the job. Promote the best and teach them to manage later.

How do you ensure consistent voice? Examples?
	Read every copy of every department. Customer support, recruiting, etc. Just scan over everything about the company.

General advice/tactics about managing people?
	Have a one-on-one every two weeks, generally. Have the employees to build the agenda.
