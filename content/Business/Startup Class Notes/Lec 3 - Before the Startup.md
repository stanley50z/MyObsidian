Paul Graham -  cofounder of YC

### Intuition - Startup is a counter-intuitive thing
- Good advices are usually against your intuitions
### However, trust your instinct on people
- Don't think of it as "oh it's just a part of being a business". No. Hire people you like.
### You don't have to be an expert in startup
- A good product matters much more
### Startup is where gaming the system won't work
- Don't look for tricks
- Build a good product, not "growth hack"
- Don't try to trick investors
### Startup is all consuming
- It takes over your entire life. There's not flexibility
- It never gets easier.
### Don't try to come up with "startup idea", they come naturally
 - Good ideas usually come up as side projects, not startup ideas
 - Instead:
	 - Learn about things that matter ([[How to Get Startup Ideas - Paul Graham|be a domain expert]], either as an user or a hacker)
	 - Work on problems that interest you (they are good problems to work on because you are an expert)
	 - ... with people you like (get co-founders)
> Live in the future, it will obvious what's missing, and that's a good startup idea.

### **Q & A**
How can a non-technical found contribute the most to the startup?
	Do the non-technical part. Sales. Take care of employees.

How to manage the first few hires?
	The first few hires are just like founders. You shouldn't have to "be managed"

Startup labs? People trying many ideas and see what works.
	They might work. Twitter started like that.

What should female founders do?
	From my empirical experience, yes they do face a harder time raising money and such. So it's especially important to build a great product and have great growth. Growth has no gender.

What would you learn in college right now?
	I might try to learn physics. I missed out on that in college.

What are your current system in work that make you efficient?
	Well I have kids, so I am forced to do more things in fewer hours. You know, I am not a very efficient person. We have deadlines at YC, so I kinda have to do it.
	If you work on something you like, you wouldn't need to "make yourself efficient"

When do you turn a side project into a startup?
	You'll notice when it takes over an alarming percentage of your life.

When a startup is sorta growing but not like explosively, what do you do?
	[[Do things that Donâ€™t Scale - Paul Graham]]

What kind of startups should not go through incubation?
	I cannot think of any. Most startups have very common problems, and that's what YC tries to solve.

You want to learn things that matter. How do you tell what matters?
	I don't know. One test on whether if you have a taste is that if you find boring things intolerable. If you don't, you either have superb self-discipline, or you don't have a good taste.

You talk about hiring people you like, this may create a monoculture. How do you deal with it.
	The advantage of hiring people you know and like is far greater than the negatives from some monoculture.
