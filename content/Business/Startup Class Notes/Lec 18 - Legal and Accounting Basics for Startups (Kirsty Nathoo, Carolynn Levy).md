### What kind of entity?
- Delaware Corporation - stable, clear, common way to found a company.
- Keep it Simple

### Be Organized
- Future due diligence requirements
- Humdrum reality of running a startup
	- Keep important documents safe

**The company is a separate entity. You should always think about you are yourself or on behalf of the company**

### Equity
**Allocation**
- Execution > Idea - don't give equity just because of the idea. The execution should be valued more.
- Founders split - It should probably be equal. Significant disproportion may be a bad sign: is every founder 100% devoted?
- Look forward, not backward
**Purchasing**
- Paperwork - stock purchase agreement, **83b election**
- two way transaction - you pay with cash, IP, etc in exchange for shares of the company
**Vesting**
- Vesting is earning the right to permanent ownership of the shares over time.
- "Standard vesting period" in SV is 4 years with 1 year cliff: after 1 year get 25%, and then the rest splits monthly.
- single founders should have vestings as well.

### Logistics
- Priced vs. Non-priced Rounds - seed is non-priced(no evaluation), series A/B are priced
	- Non-priced rounds: invest through convertible notes or SAFEs, investors are not shareholders(yet), and they get their shares once the company raises a priced round. They agree on an evaluation cap, so they benefit if the priced round evaluation is higher.
	- understand future dilution - how current investment can turn to how many percentage of shares later
	- have the documents

### Investor requests
- **Board seats** - be careful, most of the time you should say no, unless you are sure that the investor can add value to the company
- **Advisors** - the investor should automatically be a de facto advisor, but without any official title and additional returns for the advice
- **Pro-rata rights** - the right for investors to maintain their percentage of the company by being able to buy the stock up to that percentage. So it is a way to avoid dilution. *Be aware that the avoided dilution for the investors are added to the founders.**
- **Information rights** - investors almost always want contractual rights to acquire information, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But be aware of how fast the intervals are.

### Company Expenses
- What counts as a business expense?
	Things that you wouldn't feel embarrassed about when explaining to your investors
- Keeping track of expenses
	Again, keep all the receipts and store them in a safe place

### Doing Business
- Founder Employment
	Founders are employees of the company and must be paid wages - setup a payroll service.
- Founder breakups
	Working for free is against law, can be used as a leverage when founder breakups happen. So setting up a clear payroll system can eliminate that risk.

### Hiring Employees
- Contractors - consulting contract, the company doesn't withhold any tax.
- Employees - the company withhold tax, and is responsible for paying those tax.
- Both types should sign an IP agreement contract that makes the company own the IPs they created.
- You are required to have workers' compensation insurance
- You need to see proof that the employee is eligible to work in U.S

### Firing Employees
- Fire quickly
- Communicate effectively - be clear
- Pay wages up to point of termination immediately
- Cut off access to the company both physically and digitally
- Repurchase unvested stock immediately

### Know your key metrics



**Q & A**
How to you advice searching for an accountant and when in the process do you need them?
	There usually two types to hire: bookkeepers and CPA accountants. Bookkeepers categorize the expenses, and CPA do the tax returns. And at some point it's not worth the founders' time to do it, so that's when you hire someone.
	For finding them, maybe through recommendations. Also use people who are used to work with startups.

When do you hire a lawyer?
	You don't need one to incorporate, that can be done online. It also depends on what types of business you are doing, like does it involve with a lot of privacy policy?
