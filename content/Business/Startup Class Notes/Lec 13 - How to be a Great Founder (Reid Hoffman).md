Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn

### Founder Team
More often, it's two or three co-founders instead of a [[The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups - Paul Graham|solo founder]].

### Location
Go to the location where the network of particular talents and resources are, specific to the problem you are trying to solve.

### Contrarian
What would **smart** people say that counters my idea? What do I know that they don't know, and vise versa?

It's easy to be contrarian, it's difficult to be contrarian and right.

### Should I be flexible or persistent?
Have an investment thesis: why do you think this is a good idea.
Then, as you are going, does your confidence increase or decrease? That's a good metric.

### Should I minimize risks or take risks?
While you are taking intelligent risk, try to minimize other kinds of risks

> There's not one skill set. There's an ability to learn and adapt, an ability to constantly have a vision that's driving you, but to be taking input from all sources, and then to be creating networks around you, and that's essentially what makes a great founder. 

### Three layers of the company 
1. Product strategy - how to make the product, what is it like?
2. Product distribution - consumer? enterprise?
3. Financing - how to spend the money?
### Q&A
How do you find early adopters that would strengthen your investment thesis?
	Back in the time, the key is to break the noise. Today, the strategy for product distribution is how do you compete for attentions.

How do you know if someone else is a great founder?
	I am a huge believer of referrals. I only meet people by referrals. When I met with Airbnb, I made the decision to invest two minutes in, because I already know about Airbnb through referrals.

Is the density of insights a good indicator of great founders?
	I would say that the ability to say coherently what you are targeting is important. I need this level of clarity to assemble the network, employment, etc.


How did you persist through LinkedIn's journey?
	The belief that everyone need a public professional profile, and we are still the closest to that vision.

How do you evaluate and think of a co-founding team?
	Do you have a diversity of strength that spans the whole range of necessary strength? Do you collaborate well?

Different areas, different founders, how to identify them?
	Different things matter to different domains, so you should identify what matter for the field first.

How do you know when to pivot?
	Again, it depends on the confidence on your investment thesis. When you are in doubt, it's a serious timing to think about pivoting.

> Building a startup is kinda like jumping off a clip and trying to assemble an airplane midway.

How good is the startup ecosystem as identifying good opportunities?
	One mistake is to take weird combination of things that are stupid. But generally I would say the startups are good at identifying opportunities.

Creating markets vs. discovering them?
	You should rethink about **what** makes you believe that there exists this currently inexistent market in the future. What do you know that others don't?
	**One classic misfire** is that founders think people will love the product after realizing that there's a thing like this product. Steve Jobs can make it work, but usually it won't. 

When do you know you've known someone long enough to start a company?
	It's one of the risk you take. So you should go ahead and ask about important parameters to make sure you know enough.
