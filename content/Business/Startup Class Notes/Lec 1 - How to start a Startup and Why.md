### 1. Idea
> A bad idea is still a bad idea. Great execution on a bad idea will get you nowhere
- pivots are supposed to be good, sure. but they are usually something the founders already imagined and wanted
**The idea should come first, and startup second**
A great mission is needed for a group of people working on it with the required focus and productivity. It usually comes with a good idea
> The company should feel like an important mission.
