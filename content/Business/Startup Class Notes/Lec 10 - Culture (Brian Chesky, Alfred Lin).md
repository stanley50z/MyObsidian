**How to create a core value worksheet**
1. As the leader, what personal values are the most important to you?
2. What are the most important values for business success?
3. What values will you look for in employees?
4. What could never be tolerated?
5. Remember to incorporate your mission into your core value

**Best Practices for Culture**

2. Performance = think harder, deeper, longer about values
3. Interview for culture fit
4. Evaluate performance on culture as well

**Teams build products, Culture builds the teams that build the product.**

**No matter how good your initial product design is, you need to build a culture within the company for is to scale and endure.**

**Q&A with Brian**
Early story of Airbnb
> I am very fortunate to start out with my founders. They are almost intimidating because of how knowledgeable they are, and that's a good thing. It means that they are at a higher level and you feel like you need to work up a level to work with them.

Core Values
> Honest, integrity, those are not "core values" because that's what everyone should have. Core values should be unique to you.

How long did it take to hire the first employee?
	Our first employee is our first engineer. It took 5 months to hire him.
	The first few employees are the DNA of your company. You would want all the following hires to be like them, so do hire them carefully.

How having a strong culture helped you make tough decisions?
	Building a culture is for the long-term. Hiring decisions should have a "culture fit check". Let employees do the check as well.
	*Example*: A Internet clone copied us and expanded much quicker, but Airbnb won't work if it doesn't expand to the entire world. **We make the tough decision of not acquiring them, because the culture doesn't fit. They **

Percentage of revenue from Europe?
	More than 50%

"Culture and Brand are two sides of the same coin". Any opinion? How to build a brand?
	Minor point: SV is fairly weak on brand-building.
	1. Culture is the values and disciplines "inside", but that will eventually be "outside". You can't hold it within the company. *Brand is what's displayed outside that everyone identifies with.* **Have a clear mission, and make it comes through the company.**
	2. Your "brand" is often decided by your employees.
	3. Your "brand" is not what you sell, it's what you value

How to communicate the culture to users?
	Articulate the values over and over.

How do you make sure that the hosts are enforcing the culture of Airbnb?
	In the early days, we didn't pay much attention to this, and it caused a lot of issues. We do realize now that the hosts are part of the Airbnb experience. That's why we are doing "Superhost" program where we train the hosts and reinforce the values.

How did you scale up the users count?
	Make the few users **really love** you. This goes back to [[Do things that Don’t Scale - Paul Graham]]. An example of what we did is to take photos for the houses. We did it by ourself, then contractors, then employees managing the contractors, and eventually we built a system for it. This is an example of doing early works *manually* and worry about automating it later.

A lot of people think that Airbnb is more of a marketing company than a technology company. Opinion?
	 First, at our heart, we are a technology company, but here's a story.
	 Our investor once said to me that "your job as a CEO sucks in all the companies I invested in". He explains it, that since Airbnb is so international, it needs to deal with regulations, cultural conflicts, payments, safety issues, searching... There's just too many stuff to deal with.
	 So in the end, I think the best companies are usually good at many things, but we do try to hire the best talents for those jobs, so I still think that we are more of a technology company.
