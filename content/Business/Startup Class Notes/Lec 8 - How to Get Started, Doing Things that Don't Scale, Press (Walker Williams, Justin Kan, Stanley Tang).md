DoorDash - Stanley Tang, founder
Teespring - Walker Williams, founder
TwitchTV - Justin Kan, founder
#### How to Get Started
- Got the idea from talking to small business owners
	- seem [[How to Get Startup Ideas - Paul Graham|obvious]] to the founders(Stanford CS students)
	- start with a simple webpage in 1h, side project/experiment.
- It's okay to [[Do things that Don’t Scale - Paul Graham|do things manually]], like driving and writing emails

Three things the DoorDash founder learned:
1. Test your hypothesis
2. Launch fast
3. Do things that don't scale

**Q&A**
How did you customers discover DoorDash?
	Idk. We didn't do any marketing, and the initial growth is done by word of mouth. *This just validates what an urgent need we discovered that users are willing to suffer the incomplete experience*

What's the answer to your previous doubt of why companies didn't do this idea before?
	Mobile platform. We see the trend of more mobile users and mobile drivers.

How do DoorDash stands out in a competitive market?
	For us, the consumer demand has never been the problem, so we are just focusing on fulfilling those demands.
	The competition doesn't really matter when you are starting.

How long it took for us to incorporate into a company?
	We went through YC. 5 month after the launch

Teespring - Walker Williams, founder

Don't scale - unsustainable.

**Finding your first users**
- There's no silver bullet for user acquisition - do whatever it takes. 
- Don't focus on RUI, focus on growth
- **Don't give away products for free**

**Turn users into champions**
- Champions are those who voluntarily advocate for your problems.
- The way to do it: talk to your users!! (Constantly, for as long as possible)
- Ways to talk to your your users:
	- Run customer service as long as possible. [[Lec 7 - How to Build Products Users Love (Kevin Hale)|The founders do it themselves]].
	- Proactively reach out to current & churned customers
	- Social media/communities

> **Problems are inevitable, do whatever it takes to make them right**

**Finding product/market fit**
- the initial product is certainly not have a product/market fit. Iterate fast with feedbacks to find the product/market fit.
- optimize for speed over scalability/clean code
- Rule of thumb: only worry about the next order of magnitude.

> **Do things that don't scale as long as you possibly can**

**Q&A**
The t-shirt printing has a lot of competition. Why?
	I had the personal pain point. I want to print shirts, but I am dissatisfied by current solutions.

Biggest customer base?
	Entrepreneurs trying to build brands and businesses
	Influencers: youtubers, vloggers,

#### Press
TwitchTV - Justin Kan, founder

**First, figure out: who do you want to reach?**
- Press should have targeted audience and goals, like:
	Investors
	Customers
	Industry
	Position in market / brand appearance

**What is a story?**
- product launches
- fundraising
- milestones / metrics
- business overviews
- stunts - gimmicky plays营销
- hiring announcements
- contributed articles

Think about your story objectively
	If you are not founder, would you be interested to the idea you are pitching?

You don't have to be original, just original enough
	again, be interesting

**Mechanics of a story**
1. Think of  a story
2. Get introduced - reporter(s)
	A good way is to reach out to entrepreneurs who just got covered. let them connect you to the reporter
3. Set a date (4-7 days in advance)
4. Reach out (**get a commitment** to invest time)
5. Pitch
	Write a bullet list of what you want to convey. guide the conversation with the bullet points
6. Follow up
	Before the news are sent out, reach out to send critical info that you want to be mentioned
	Cofounders, media examples, etc
7. Launch your news

**PR Firms**
- Firms can only help with contacts(maybe) and follow up
- Firms can't generate stories
	They cannot tell why your product is interesting
- Firms are expensive, not very worthy

**Getting press is work**
- Make sure it is worth it
- Getting press doesn't mean you are successful
- Press is not a scalable user acquisition strategy

**If you decide press is worth it**
- Keep contacts fresh
- Regular heartbeat of news
- Golden rule: help fellow entrepreneurs to get coverage as well

**Q&A**
When is the right time to worry about press altogether?
	Maybe do one story that may get you the initial 100 users is good enough(go against [[Do things that Don’t Scale - Paul Graham|recruiting manually]]??). Don be obsessed about it.

How to get a big and good story?
	Set the stage by having existing stories, so complete strangers from the medias get some context
	Offer follow up stories for reporters
