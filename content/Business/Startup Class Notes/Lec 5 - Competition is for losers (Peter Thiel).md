### Capturing value
Say a company create X dollars of value, and capture Y% of X
	X and Y are independent variable!
There are just two kinds of companies: perfectly competitive, and monopoly
### Lies that people tell
Monopoly companies tell that they are competitive to avoid regulation
Competitive companies tell that they are unique and less competitive to differentiate and raise capital

### How to build a monopoly
**start small and monopolize**
	It's easier to dominate a small market than to dominate a large one
	Then, expand
**Technology**
	A sign for good technology is that an order of magnitude better than the next best thing

- Network effect
- Proprietary technology
- economy of scale
- brand

### Last mover advantage
**Build to last**
	Replacing the current solution is good, but how do you make sure that you don't get replaced yourself?
When you face a lot of competition, you may have amazing innovations that benefit the customers, but not the company itself
### History of Innovation
The fact about scientists: those who invent technology that greatly benefit the society rarely get rewarded.

### Psychology of competition
- Don't take competition as a form of validation
- Don't mimic what others are doing
- Think about if the competition makes sense

### Q&A
Do you have any ways to easily determine the difference between an idea and your idea?
	The question I always tell myself is: what's the actual market.
