What matters most for growth?
**Retention.**
![[Pasted image 20240703204828.png|300]]
You want a curve that becomes parallel to the x-axis: **that's how you get a viable business**
You want to have a great product that has product-market-fit

> Startup should not have growth teams. The whole company should be the growth team.

**The metric, the "north star", for growth is decided by the CEO. It's important to have one.**
 
**Magic Moment**
There should be a WOW moment that people feel when they use your product. Connect new users to that moment as fast as possible, and that's how you get retention.

**Take time to build a scalable product**

#### Tactics
**Virality**
- payload - how many people
- conversion rate - how many of them convert(**most important**)
	remove friction out of the flow
- frequency - how many times
	the higher the frequency you hit people with the same ad, the lower the conversion rate
**Search Engine Optimization(SEO)**
- Do your research first about what you're gonna go after
- research include: 
	- what do people search for related to your sites
	- how many people search for it
	- how many other people are ranking for it
	- how valuable is it for you
- A good tool is Google Adwords 
- get valuable links from high authority websites

**Spamming Emails, SMS, etc**
- The primary goal is to get the delivered, i.e. not get blocked and blacklisted
