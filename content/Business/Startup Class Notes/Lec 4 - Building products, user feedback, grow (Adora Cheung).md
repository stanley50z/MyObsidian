Adora Cheung - Homejoy(bankrupted)
### Customer feedback
*** Have a support hotline/email!
surveys, interviews(better)
quantitative: retention, ratings, NPS
qualitative: ask why, why, why

### Building mvp
build fast, optimize for now
manual first, automate later
temporary brokenness > permanent paralysis
	worry about generic cases, don't care to make it perfect
beware of frankenstein

### After mvp
launch your product, do not wait because afraid of someone copying your idea(they will, but you have the advantage)

### more users
learn one channel at a time
 iterate working channels
 revisit failed channels
 key = creativity

### growth
1. sticky growth
	good experience wins
	covid+retention cohort analysis(important)
	repeat users buy more and more
2. viral growth
	Wow experience + good referral programs
	1. customer touch points
	2. program mechanics
	3. referral conversion flow
	(referral: might be more important to service type??)
3. paid growth
	Advertisments

### the art of pivoting
1. bad growth
2. bad retention
3. bad economics
