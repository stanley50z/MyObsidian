1.3
Master List: [[TAOE Master List]]

### 1.3.1 Sinusoidal Signals - most common
- Amplitude $A$, frequency $f$, and phase shift $\phi$
- Angular frequency $\omega = 2\pi f$
> The great merit of sinewave is the fact that they are the solutions to certain linear differential equations that happened to describe many phenomena in nature as well as the properties of **linear circuits**. 

### 1.3.2 Signal amplitudes and decibels
- peak-to-peak amplitude (pp amplitude)
- root-mean-square amplitude (rms amplitude), used to compute power
- For sine waves, $V_{rms}=\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2 }}\right)A$
##### A. Decibels
- $dB=10\log_{10}\frac{P_{2}}{P_{1}}=20\log_{10}\frac{A_{2}}{A_{1}}$
- P is power in signals, A is amplitudes

### 1.3.3 Other signals
- Ramp
- Triangle
- Noise
- Square wave
- Pulses
- Steps and spikes

### 1.3.5 Signal sources
**Signal generators**
- usually sinewave oscillators
	- inside, the sinewave is usually generated by *frequency synthesizer*
**Pulse generators**
**Function generators**
- most flexible
- now, often digital
