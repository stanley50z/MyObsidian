**Variable resistors**
aka potentiometers, volume controls, pots, trimmers

It is also possible to build an all-electronic potentiometer using transistors and resistors.
While it sounds convenient to use a potentiometer instead of resistors all the time, but this is bad because:
- potentiometers are not as stable
- potentiometers are not as accurate

**Variable capacitors**
usually has small capacitance values(up to about 1000pF)
diodes operated with applied reverse voltage can al so be used as voltage-variable capacitors
both are common in RF circuits

**Variable inductors**
by moving a piece of core material in a fixed coil. Or, variometer, by rotating the inner coil

**Variable transformers**
convenient for testing the device under different voltages. Provided a 115V AC, a typical variable transformer can output 0 to 135V AC
