Say a RF signal: $\large [A+f(t)]\sin 2\pi f_{c}t$.
$\large f_{c}$ would be the carrier frequency. The constant $\large A$ is added so the coefficient is never negative.

- parallel LC picks up the radio frequency(carrier)
- Diode rectify the signal
- R directs the current slightly
- C is used to smooth-out the high frequency noise
- RC is selected so that it would be long compared with a carrier period(won't get charged), but short compared to the highest audio frequency(thus noise with higher frequency get smoothed out)
